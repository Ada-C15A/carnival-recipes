Chris' Steamed Buns
-------------------
Time: 4 hours

Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 cup panko breadcrumbs
1 tablespoon olive oil

9. Whisk in the milk until you have a thick enough sauce that it coats the back of a spoon.
13. Take the rest of the crumbled bacon and add it to the bowl, stirring well to combine.

1 tablespoon vegetable oil

3. Knead until dough surface is smooth and elastic. Roll over in a greased bowl, and let stand until triple in size, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
12. REMOVE LID BEFORE you turn off heat, or else water will drip back onto bun surface and produce yellowish "blisters" on bun surfaces.
